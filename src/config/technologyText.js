Javascript is the language I use on a
daily basis. In my previous work, I have
mastered many concepts of JavaScript.
I know what is scope, closure, asynchronous
functions, promises, build-in functions,
recursive functions, self invoke function...

This site was written using THREE.js.
It is a powerful 3D rendering library.
In combination with WebGL shaders the
result is WOW! Look at that model!

The web wouldn't be the web without CSS.
I prefer SCSS because of cleaner code and
use of functions, mixins and nesting. I made
a lot of CSS animations, I also used SVG.
API integration is a must in today's web.
I was doing the integration of various APIs.

I mostly use React.js in my projects.
Reusable components greatly improve and
speed up work. I also did a project using
React Native for a mobile app.

Python, first love never forgets. It's
the first language I used. Later, I mostly
used it in the field of cyber security,
for writing scripts. Also, I've dealt with
networks, protocols, layers... Linux is
the standard in cyber security, so the
terminal is an old friend of me!
